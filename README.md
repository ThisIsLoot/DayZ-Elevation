# DayZ-Elevation

A few scripts I wrote to create the [Sakhal Elevation Map](https://thisisloot.com/sakhal-elevation-map). 

TIL_ElevationData.c is an Enforce script to get Y-values (i.e. height) over an entire DayZ map based on a provided resolution.

XYZtoYarray.py is a small Python script to take the output of TIL_ElevationData.c and convert into an array that can be plotted using Observable's Contour Mark method.
